Solving this challenge will unlock more "Shop- " challenges in the DFIR category.

All the "Shop- " challenges in the DFIR category use the same JSON data set (DownUnderShop.JSON) which can be downloaded from here.

We'd encourage you to use a log analytics tool such as Splunk (1 week free cloud trial) to assist with analysing the logs.

These logs and scenarios are designed to be real-ish, they're simpler and given that the entire data set covers 1hr all malicious activity is conducted on a condensed time frame.

The structure of the fake website being targeted is a basic online store with browsing, purchasing and account functionality.

Flag formats will not be in the standard DUCTF{} format.

THE FLAG FOR THIS CHALLENGE IS: IAgreeToTheTeasAndTheSeas.

Feedback is very highly encouraged.

Registering for a free 1 week  Splunk Cloud instance was fine, but I always got:

The server can not presently handle the given request.
